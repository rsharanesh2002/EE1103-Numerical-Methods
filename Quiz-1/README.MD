### Write the Linux terminal commands to do these activities (submit the commands used for each of these)

1. Find the top  25 processes running on your machine
2. Print the last 30 lines of a text file
3. Ping a website for 1 minute and redirect the output to a text file
4. Use grep and sed to process the output from ping and print only the 3 numeric values into a text file
5. Use awk to calculate the mean and stdev of the 3rd column of numbers in the text file

### Write a C-program

1. Takes in 3 arguments on the command line (after a.out. N mean std)
2. Converts each of the arguments into integers and floats (as needed)
3. Generates N random numbers with given mean and stdev
4. Writes the random numbers in to a file
5. Reads the random numbers from the file
6. Calculates the mean and stdev and returns the difference in values between that expect and that calculated
