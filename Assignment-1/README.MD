Simple exercises to get into a rhythm
1. Use ping to generate a data set (redirect stdout to a file e.g. ping.dat)
2. Use awk, grep, sed to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the packet arrival times
3. Write a C-program to do the same things (at different levels of expertise)

For writing the C-program
* Use the rand function to generate random numbers
* Read a data file with numbers (learn to use fscanf)
* Read ping.dat and extract the time on each row, then use it
* Run ping from within the C-program
