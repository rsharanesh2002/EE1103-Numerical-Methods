Optical traps are interesting instruments that are used to trap and study particles. They rely on some simple physical principles like conservation of momentum, and Brownian motion. Let us simulate the movement of one such trapped particle as a function of temperature.

1. Please check the units of the equations you use. Or check the theory here https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/038/pdf
2. You MUST submit your files with the correct file names e.g. 2M_q2.c  and 2M_q2.pdf would be the filenames submitted by group 2M.
3. Remember to catch all errors. If a program doesn't run when compiled, or yields a warning on compilation, you lose significant marks
4. Follow the proper convention for comments at the start of the code. Comments within the code should be elegant, and not distract from the flow of logic
5. Proper indentation is essential to make the code readable.
6. Marks will be given for the use of proper variable names. Everything cannot be tmp or x. Integers are usually i, j, k, m, n, p. and floats are a,b, x, y, etc. Constants must have capital letters e.g. N
7. The pdf should properly explain the logic of your code, and should have the final plot with properly named axis and labels of a reasonable font size. e.g. https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/brownian_motion_simulation_test/motion_1d.png
